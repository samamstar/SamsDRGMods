# This repo is outdated! I got sick of having all my projects in the same Unreal project, so I made the [SamsDRGMods](https://github.com/SamsDRGMods) organization to help keep me sane


### Welcome to the SamsDRGMods repository!
## What is it?
I wanted to have one central space to put a bunch of related mods. Hence this repo. It includes everything I'm currently working on, most of which is tied directly into my main project, a shared settings window between all of my mods

## Installation instructions
1. Install ArcticEcho's [blueprint mod manager](https://github.com/ArcticEcho/DRG-BP-Mod-Manager)
2. Get the most recent version from [the releases page](https://github.com/samamstar/SamsDRGMods/releases) (it should be called modPack)
3. download and extract the zip
4. locate the installation instructions text file
5. follow its instructions to copy the mods into your paks folder
  - You can feel free to delete unwanted mods from the Paks\SamsMods folder. Just make sure not to delete Core or ModHook
